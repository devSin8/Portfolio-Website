# Portfolio Website
This project is a personal portfolio website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases personal information, projects, and provides a contact form for users to reach out. The project is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, offering a smooth browsing experience across different devices.
### Features

    Home Section: A brief introduction about the developer.
    About Me Section: An overview of the developer's background, skills, and experiences.
    Portfolio Section: A showcase of various projects with descriptions.
    Contact Form: A simple contact form where users can send a message (currently under development).

### Future Development

The current version of the portfolio website does not have backend functionality. In future iterations, the following features will be added:

    Backend Integration:
        A basic server (using Node.js/Express) will be set up to handle form submissions from the contact page.
        Messages submitted via the contact form will be processed, logged, or stored in a database.

    Database Integration:
        In a future update, a database (such as MongoDB or MySQL) will be added to store contact form submissions.
        This will allow for better management and tracking of user queries.
